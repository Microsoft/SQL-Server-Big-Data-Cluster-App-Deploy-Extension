# SQL Server Big Data Cluster App Deploy Extension

Visual Studio Code Extension for deploying applications to a SQL Server Big Data Cluster

## Example Usage

This extension is in preview.  If you find any bugs or have any feedback, feel free to reach out.

### Install

Download the sqlservbdc-app-deploy .vsix file in order to install the extension as part of Visual Studio Code.

Launch VS Code and navigate to the Extensions sidebar.

Click the `â€¦` context menu on the top of the side bar and select `Install from vsix`

![Install VSIX](assets/images/install_vsix.png)

Find the sqlservbdc-app-deploy .vsix file you downloaded and choose that to install

Once the SQL Server Big Data Cluster App Deploy extension has been installed, it will prompt you to reload VS Code.  You should now see the SQL Server BDC App Explorer in your sidebar.

### App Explorer

When you click on it, a side pane will load showing you that you have no apps or app specifications available:

#### New Connection

You may connect to your cluster endpoint either by clicking on the status bar at the bottom that says `SQL Server BDC Disconnected` or you may click on the `New Connection` button at the top with the arrow pointing into a doorway.  **Please connect to the controller endpoint at https://\<ip\>:30080.  The proxy endpoint at https://\<ip\>:30777 is no longer be valid.**

![New Connection](assets/images/connect_to_cluster.png)

**Please use version 1.4.0, if you would like to do an Active Directory (AD) login. Version 1.1.0 only supports Basic.  Version 1.4.0 is compatible with the latest version of Visual Studio Code (v1.53.2).**  You will then be prompted for the appropriate endpoint, username, and password.  If given the correct credentials and app endpoint, you will be notified that you've been connected to the cluster and you will see any deployed apps populated in the sidebar. If you successfully connect, your endpoint and username will be saved to ./sqldbc as part of your user profile.  No password or tokens will ever be saved.  When logging in again, the prompt will prefill with your saved host and username but always require you to input a password.  If you wish to connect to a different cluster endpoint, just click the `New Connection` again.  The connection will automatically close if you close VS Code or if you open a different workspace and you will need to reconnect.

### App Template

To deploy a brand new app from one of our templates, click on the `New App Template` button on the `App Specifications` pane, where you will be prompted for the name, the runtime, and what location you would like to place the new app in on your local machine.  It is advised that you place it in your current VS Code workspace so that you can use the full functionality of the extension, but you may place it anywhere in your local file system:

![New App Template](assets/images/new_app_template.png)

Once completed, a new App Template will be scaffolded for you at the location you specified and the deployment spec.yaml will open in your workspace.  If the directory you selected is in your workspace, you will also be able to see it listed under the `App Specifications` pane:

![Loaded App Template](assets/images/loading_app_template.png)

The template is a simple `Hello World` app that is laid out as follows:
- `spec.yaml`
    - Tells the cluster how to deploy your app
- `run-spec.yaml`
    - Tells the cluster how you'd like to call your app
- `handler.py`
    - This is your source code file as specified by `src` in spec.yaml
    - It has one function called `handler` that is considered the `entrypoint` of the app as shown in `spec.yaml`.  It takes in a string input called `msg` and returns a string output called `out`.  These are specified in `inputs` and `outputs` of the `spec.yaml`.  

If you do not want a scaffolded template and would just prefer a spec.yaml for deployment of an app you have already built, you may click the `New Deploy Spec` button next to the `New App Template` button and go through the same process, but you will just receive the spec.yaml, which you may modify how you choose.

### Deploy App

You may instantly deploy this App through the code lens `Deploy App` in the spec.yaml or you may press the lightning folder button next to the spec.yaml file in the App Specifications menu. The extension will zip up all files in the directory where your spec.yaml is located and deploy your app to the cluster. **Please ensure that all of your app files are in the same directory as your spec.yaml.  The spec.yaml must be at the root level of your app source code directory.**  

![Deploy App Button](assets/images/deploy_app_lightning.png)

![Deploy App Codelens](assets/images/deploy_app_codelens.png)

You will be notified when the app is ready for consumption based on the state of the app in the sidebar:

![App Deployed](assets/images/app_deploy.png)

![App Ready Side Bar](assets/images/app_ready_side_bar.png)

![App Ready Notification](assets/images/app_ready_notification.png)


From the side pane, you will be able to see the following available to you:

You may view all apps you have deployed in the side bar with the following information:

- state
- version
- input parameters
- output parameters
- links
    - swagger
    - details

If you click `Links`, you will see that you can access the swagger.json of your deployed app, so that you may write your own clients which call your app:

![Swagger](assets/images/swagger.png)


### App Run

Once the app is ready, you may call the app with the run-spec.yaml that was given as part of the app-template:

![Run Spec](assets/images/run_spec.png)

Here you may specify any string you'd like in place of `hello` and then again run it through the codelens link or the lightning button in the side bar next to the run-spec.yaml.  If you do not have a run-spec for whatever reason, you may always generate one from the deployed app in the cluster:

![Get Run Spec](assets/images/get_run_spec.png)

Once you have one and have edited it to your satisfaction, run it, and you will be given the appropriate feedback when the app has finished running:

![App Output](assets/images/app_output.png)

As you can see from above, the output is given in a temporary .json file in your workspace.  If you would like to keep this output, feel free to save it, otherwise, it will be deleted on closing.  If your app has no output to print to a file, you will only get the `Successful App Run` notification at the bottom.  If you did not have a successful run, you will receive an appropriate error message that will help you determine what is wrong.

When running an app, there are a variety of ways to pass parameters:

You may specify all inputs required through a .json, i.e.

- `inputs: ./example.json`

When calling a deployed app, if any input parameters are innate to the app or user specified and that given input parameter is anything other than a primitive, such as an Array, Vector, Dataframe, complex JSON, etc. you may specify that directly in line when calling the app, i.e.

- Vector
    - `inputs:`
        - `x: [1, 2, 3]`
- Matrix
    - `inputs:`
        - `x: [[A,B,C],[1,2,3]]`
- Object
    - `inputs:`
        - `x: {A: 1, B: 2, C: 3}`

Or you may also give a string as a relative or absolute file path to a .txt, .json, or .csv that gives the required input in the format that your app requires.  The file parsing is based on `Node.js Path library`, where a file path is defined as a `string that contains a / or \ character`.

If the input parameter is not provided as needed, an appropriate error message will be shown with either the incorrect file path if a string file path was given or that parameter was invalid.  The responsibility is given to the creator of the app to ensure they understand the parameters they are defining.

If you would like to delete the app for any reason, just click the Trash can button next to the app in the `Deployed Apps` side pane.

## Architecture

### VS Code
All VS Code Extensions have an `extension.ts` file at the root of the `src` directory.

The primary objective of this file is to run the `activate()` function when the extension is initialized.  The activate function proceeds to create all views, services, and controllers necessary and then registers the respective VS Code components to the methods from the controllers.  In addition, all VS Code registrations are pushed on to a disposable array that is disposed of on deactivation of the extension.

The extension itself is defined within the `package.json`, which is known as the **manifest** file for VS Code extensions.  This is where the structure of the UI is defined, i.e. what views and commands are being added in which menus.

### Controllers

There are two primary controllers for the app:

- **src/controllers/configController.ts**
    - This controller is in charge of getting the configuration object from the *configService.ts* if it exists, otherwise prompting the user for credentials through the *configInput.ts* view, and using it to login to the cluster through the *tokenService.ts*
- **src/controllers/appController.ts**
    - This controller is in charge of managing the app life cycle: getting a template or deployment spec, deployment of an app, running an app, and deleting an app.

### Views

For this project, views are defined as UI logic specific to VS Code and they are located in the **src/views** directory.  There are a few primary types of views:

- **Tree Views**
    - *appTree.ts*
        - Contains all of the view logic for representing the `Deployed Apps` tree on the side pane
    - *specTree.ts*
        - Contains all of the view logic for representing `App Specifications` tree on the side pane
- **Input Views**
    All of these are based on *multiStepInput.ts*
    - *configInput.ts*
        - View logic for configuration user input
    - *specInput.ts*
        - View logic for app template and deployment spec user input
    - *runSpecInput.ts*
        - View logic for run spec user input
- **Code Lens**
    - *specCodeLensProvider.ts*
        - View logic for the injected codelens to `Deploy App` or `Run App`
- **Notifications**
    - *notificationProvider.ts*
        - View logic for displaying notifications to user

### Services
For this project, services are defined as all of the business logic for making HTTP requests and File System manipulation.  There are 4 services:

- **tokenService.ts**
    - Contains all logic for retrieving the JWT from the cluster through HTTP requests
- **configService.ts**
    - Contains all logic for storing configuration in memory and to save host and username to ./sqlbdc in the user profile
- **specService.ts**
    - Contains all logic for file system manipulation while dealing with the specification yamls for deployment and running of apps
- **appService.ts**
    - Contains all logic for making HTTP requests concerning apps in the cluster

### Constants
Messaging strings, runtime types, storage location, etc. can all be found as hard coded values in this directory so that there is a consistent place to change any of these values in the future to avoid potential bugs.

### Models
All interface contracts are defined here that are used by the services and controllers as well as a few object implementations of these interfaces where it was valuable

### Util
All miscellaneous helper methods are located here
